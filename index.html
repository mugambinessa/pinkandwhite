        <p><strong>"You showed me love"</strong> in a way I didn’t always know how to receive, but I see it now, and I want you to know that I will never take that for granted again.</p>

        <p>There aren’t enough words to express how deeply I regret the pain I have caused you. Hearing how I hurt you has been heavy on my heart, and I want you to know that I carry that weight with full responsibility, not just as something to apologize for, but as something to learn & grow from. You are one of the most beautiful souls I have ever known, and I never want my actions to make you feel anything less than cherished, appreciated, and deeply loved.</p>

        <p>These pink and white roses symbolize everything I feel for you. <strong>Pink for gratitude</strong> because I admire the strength, kindness, and love you’ve given me, and I’m endlessly grateful for you. <strong>White for a fresh start</strong>, a new chapter where I love you with more patience, more presence, and the tenderness you deserve.</p>

        <p>I can’t change the past, but I commit to you this... I will never stop choosing to be better. Not just in words, but in action, in consistency, in the way I show up for you every single day, even when things get difficult. When it’s hard, when wounds resurface, when doubts creep in... In those moments, I will not run, I will not shut down and I will not let my fears or past mistakes dictate our future. Instead, I will stand beside you, fully present, fully committed, fully in love, working through everything with you.</p>

        <p>I vow to pick up every single broken piece of us, carefully, gently, and with all the love in my heart, so that we can mend what was hurt and rebuild something even stronger. Not just trying to fix what was, but creating a space for us to start fresh, to begin again as if we just met, with our hallway middle school type crush, and with an excitement for all that we can still become. I don’t want to just go back to how things were but I want us to continuously find new things that are special to us, new reasons to love each other, new moments that remind us why we’re here, choosing each other over and over again.</p>

        <p>And this gift, these words & this moment are not just about asking for forgiveness. They’re not meant to erase the past or make you feel obligated to let go of what hurt. They are just simply here to remind you that you are special. That you always have been. That no mistake, no moment of pain, no regret could ever take away from that fact. I hate that you ever felt anything less than that, and that you doubted your worth in my eyes. No matter what happens, I need you to know that I see you, I appreciate you, and I will spend every single day proving to you that you are very much special to me.</p>

        <p>I love you deeply, endlessly, and in a way that time, distance, or mistakes could never erase. And if all goes well, I want to spend forever growing, healing, rediscovering, and falling in love with you again and again and again. 🩷🤍</p>
